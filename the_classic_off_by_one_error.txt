\\Buggy Code:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int arr[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i <= 10; i++) { 
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}

\\Error: The problem is in the loop condition. I used i <= 10 but the array only has 10 elements which goes from 0 to 9. When the loop tries to access arr[10], it goes out of bounds because there's no 11th element. This causes the program to crash.

\\Fixed Code:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int arr[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
