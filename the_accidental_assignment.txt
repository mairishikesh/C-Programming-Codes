\\Buggy Code:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i = 5; i++) {
        printf("Hello\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

\\Error: I accidentally wrote i = 5 in the condition part instead of i < 5. The single equal sign fixes 5 to i, and since 5 is a non-zero value, it's always true. So the loop never stops and keeps running forever. I should have used the comparison operator instead.

\\Fixed Code:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        printf("Hello\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
